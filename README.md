# plant-disease-recognition
PDR based on modified PlantVillage Dataset


About the dataset:
This is modified version of PlantVillage Dataset.
This dataset has been modified to work with data generators of Keras library.
The annotations has been modified so that labelling is easier. 
The train-test split is set at 85:15.

Description:
There 5 ipython notebooks that are aimed at recognizing plant diseases. There is one notebook each for VGG19, Xception, InceptionV3, ResNet105V2, and EfficientNetB7. Additionally, to the pretrained models, the following layers have been added: 1 Batch normalization layer, 1 Dense layers of 512 nodes, and 1 Dense layer for softmax classification.

Futher Details will be added.
